# Apple Macintosh Development Environment setup

These instructions will install a web development coding environment on your machine and set up all the required accounts that you will need on your Apple Macintosh computer.

## Step 1: Create web development accounts

You will need to use two different services in the process: GitHub & Heroku.

> **Note:** You may be prompted if you want to install programs on your machine when setting up GitHub and Heroku account — you will not need to install these programs yet.

### GitHub

GitHub is a service that will allow you to collaborate and back-up your code.  You will need to create an account on this site.

**First**, visit [GitHub.com](http://github.com) and create an account.

### Heroku

Heroku is a service that will allow you to put your project live on the Internet.  You will need to create an account on this site.

**Second**, visit [Heroku.com](http://Heroku.com) and create an account.


## Step 2: [Suggested] Setup vagrant

Vagrant is a program that will allow you to run a virtual machine on your computer — and within this virtual machine you can run your web application projects.

This next step is the suggested install process.  Some computers do not work well with vagrant — if this happens using an alternative could be helpful.

## Step 2: [Alternative] Setup a Cloud IDE

Sometimes, when trying to set up virtual computers on your machine problems will arise.  At these times, it is often the best solution to use a Cloud IDE solution.

Cloud IDEs will give you a professional coding environment all within your web browser.  There are a number of reasons to use Cloud IDEs.

* They can work regardless of the computer you're using if you can visit sites inside your web browser.
* They provide the flexibility to log into your environment from different computers.
* Since everything will be access through a browser, they often can work with unusual Internet, firewall or routing restrictions.

Since these Cloud IDEs will give you the full power of a linux virtual machine that is accessible within a web browser, this is a great option to set up a coding environment with, also.

## Step 3:  Understand your environment
