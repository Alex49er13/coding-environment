# Apple Macintosh Development Environment setup

These instructions will install a web development coding environment on your machine and set up all the required accounts that you will need on your Apple Macintosh computer.

## Step 1: Create web development accounts

You will need to use two different services in the process: GitHub & Heroku.

> **Note:** You may be prompted if you want to install programs on your machine when setting up GitHub and Heroku account — you will not need to install these programs yet.

### GitHub

GitHub is a service that will allow you to collaborate and back-up your code.  You will need to create an account on this site.

**First**, visit [GitHub.com](http://github.com) and create an account.

### Heroku

Heroku is a service that will allow you to put your project live on the Internet.  You will need to create an account on this site.

**Second**, visit [Heroku.com](http://Heroku.com) and create an account.


## Step 2: [Suggested] Setup vagrant

Vagrant is a program that will allow you to run a virtual machine on your computer — and within this virtual machine you can run your web application projects.

> **Note:** Make sure to close any other virtualization environments you have running.  If you happen to be running Parallels, VirtualBox or VMWare for other reasons, you will need to close them.

This next step is the suggested install process.  Some computers do not work well with vagrant — if this happens using an alternative could be helpful.

## Step 2: [Alternative] Setup a CloudIDE

## Step 3:  Understand your environment
